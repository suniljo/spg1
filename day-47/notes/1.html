HTML Document Structure:
------------------------

An HTML document has got two sections:

(1) Header Section 
  <head>		
    .......
  </head>

It is used to provide general information about the web page like:
> title for the web page
> integrate CSS & Java Scripts
> integrate external CSS and Java Script links
> specify the meta information. UTF-8 is a character encoding standard used for electronic communication.
> provide the information for search engine
> to provide favicon
etc

(2) Body Section 
 <body>
  .......
 </body>

- used to specify the visible page content, which will be displayed in the document region of the browser

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
	
 </head>
	
 <body>

 </body>
</html>


The <!DOCTYPE> declaration
--------------------------
- it defines the document type to be HTML.
- it is not an HTML tag.
- it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

<!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5  is:
    <!DOCTYPE html>





HTML document can be created using any of the editors like:
(1) Notepad
(2) Editplus
(3) Notepad++
(4) Sublime Text Editor
(5) Atom Editor (GitHub)
(6) Brackets Editor  (Adobe)
(7) Jetbrains Webstorm 
(8) Dream Weaver (Adobe)
(9) Visual Studio Code (MS)
etc


HTML Heading Tags
-----------------
Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags and are paired tags. 

<h1> - It is used to create first level heading or main heading
  <h1>heading here</h1>

<h2> - second level heading or sub heading
<h3> 
<h4>
<h5>
<h6> - Least Level Heading

While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading - block elements.


Steps to create a Web Page::
----------------------------

1) Open any editor like Notepad, Notepad++, Edit Plus, etc

2) Write the following in the editor

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <title>HTML | Headings</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h1>This is Heading-1</h1>
  <h2>This is Heading-2</h2>
  <h3>This is Heading-3</h3> 
  <h4>This is Heading-4</h4>
  <h5>This is Heading-5</h5>
  <h6>This is Heading-6</h6>
 </body>
</html>


3) Save the above document as "Headings.html" in any directory (D:\HTML)

4) Open the above file (Headings.html) in any browser. 



HTML Paragraph Tag
------------------
Paragraphs are defined with <p> tag.

<p> tag is a paired tag and is a block element.

 <p> ... paragraph data .... </p>

To get some sample text for practice : www.blindtextgenerator.com    Lorem Ipsum in VSCode


Line Break Tag
--------------
<br> - stands for break
<br> is an empty tag

&nbsp; - Non Breakable Space  (No Break Space)
- used to add space between words or characters.
It is a special character (entity) in HTML. 




Generally the browser accept single line and single space

  Wipro &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Technologies


Centering Content
-----------------
<center> - tag used to put any content in the center of the page or any container

<center> 
  <h1>Wipro</h1>
</center>


- Inline elements takes content width as its own width.
- Block level elements takes parent width as its own width.


<DIV> Tag
---------
- it defines a division or section in an HTML document
- <div> is a container tag and inside that we can add any number of tags
- <div> tag is used with block-level content.
- by default no styles are added to <div>
The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc)


<SPAN> Tag
----------
- this tag is also for making sections in a web page
- it is an inline element
- <span> tag is used for grouping and applying styles to inline elements.


<h2>
 <span style="color:red">Congnizant</span> 
 <span style="color:blue">Technologies</span> </h2>



Difference between <div> and <span>:
-------------
<div> is a block element, <span> is inline element

<div> should be used to wrap sections of a document
<span> should be used to wrap a portion of text


- Block level elements:
   - elements that takes parent's width by default
     Eg: <h1>,<p>,...
- Inline element:
   - elements that takes content width  
     Eg: <a>,<img>,... 


HTML Horizontal Rules
---------------------
<hr> - an empty tag that creates a horizontal line in a web page. 

<hr color=red width="50%" size=5 align=left>




Text Formatting Tags
--------------------
HTML Formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel. HTML provides us ability to format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. These tags are used to make text bold, italicized, or underlined.

The following HTML tags are used to format the appearance of the text on your web page.

1) Bold Text:

<b>		defines bold text
<strong>	defines strong text
The text in between the tags will be bold, and stand out against text around it, the same as in a word processor.
Note: using <strong> instead of <b>, means you are using Semantic Markup. It is used in Text-to-Speech programs (screen readers)

2) Italics Text:
<i>		defines italic text
<em>		defines emphasized text
italics displays the text at a slight angle.
Used to emphasize text, which usually appears in italics, but can vary according to your browser.

3) Striking Text:
<strike> or <s>
<del>		defines deleted text

4) Underlined Text:
<u>
<ins>		defines inserted text

5) Script Text:
<sub>		defines subscripted text
<sup>		defines superscripted text

6) <mark> 	used for indicating text as marked or highlighted for reference purposes

etc







Computer Output Tags 
--------------------
1) <pre>	Defines preformatted text
Any text between the pre tags, including spaces, carriage returns and punctuation, will appear in the browser as it would in a text editor (normally browsers ignore multiple spaces)


2) <code>	Defines computer code text
Text is displayed in a fixed-width font, commonly used when showing source code

<pre>
 <code>
  int x = 5;
  int y = 6;
  int z = x + y;
  System.out.println("Sum = "+z);
 </code>
</pre> 

3) <kbd>	Defines keyboard text 

 <p>
  Open a file by pressing <kbd>ALT + F + O</kbd>  
 </p> 

4) <samp>	Defines sample output from a computer program. 

 <p>If you input wrong value, the program will return <samp>Exception!</samp></p> 

5) <tt>		Defines teletype text
The text appears to have been typed by a typewriter, in a fixed-width font

6) <var>	Defines a variable
The variable could be a variable in a mathematical expression or a variable in programming context

Ex:
<div>
 Einstein defined: 
  <var>E</var> =    <var>mc</var><sup>2</sup>. 
</div>


Citation & Quotations Tags 
--------------------------

1) <abbr>	defines an abbreviation

2) <acronym> 	defines an acronym

Note: <acronym> tag is not supported in HTML5

Eg: 
<abbr title="Cognizant Technologies">C T S</abbr> is addressed at Hyderabad

3) <address>  defines an address element

4) <bdo>   defines the text direction
 <bdo dir="rtl"> Cognizant Technologies</bdo>

5) <q>	defines a short quotation
  <q>All that glitters is not gold</q>

6) <blockquote> defines a long quotation. Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
Defines a long quotation, and the quote is displayed with an extra wide margin on the left hand side of the block quote.

7) <cite>  defines a citation, the title of a work

Small - <small> </small>
    Instead of having to set a font size, you can use the small tag to render text slightly smaller than the text around it. Useful for displaying the 'fine-print'.



Ex:
<blockquote>
 Any in-accuracies in this index may be explained by the fact that it has been sorted with the help of a computer.<br>
   from <cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite> by Donald Knuth
</blockquote>

8) <dfn>	defines a definition term, defining instance of a term in HTML
Ex:
A <dfn>definition</dfn> is an explanation of the meaning of a word.

=========================== Cascading Style Sheets ========================

Cascading Style Sheets:
=======================

1) CSS is a style sheet language 

2) CSS is used for describing the presentation of a web page

3) CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page

4) Styles define how to display HTML elements 

Advantages of CSS:
------------------
1) CSS saves a lot of work and time

2) It can control the layout of multiple web pages

3) Easy maintenance 

4) Multiple Device Compatibility - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device (responsive design).

5) Flexibility - we can update style sheets as per the client needs


CSS - Syntax:
-------------
The CSS syntax is made up of three parts: 
 (1) a selector, (2) a property and  (3) a value

 selector 
 {
   property: value;
 }

selector- indicates the HTML element you want to style. 

Declaration Block( { } ): 
- it can contain one or more declarations separated by a semicolon. 

Each declaration contains a property name and value, separated by a colon (:)

Property- a type of attribute of HTML element. It could be "color", "border" etc.

Value- values assigned to CSS properties. 


How to add CSS?
---------------
There are three ways to insert CSS in HTML documents.

1) Inline Styles
- used to define a unique style to a single HTML element.
Inline styling uses the "style" attribute

Example:
<h2 style="color:red;margin-left:40px;"> Inline CSS </h2>  
<h2>This heading is not affected</h2>


2) Internal Styles
------------------
The internal style is used to define a unique style for one web page. 

It is normally defined in <head> section of the HTML page inside the <style> tag.

<head>
 <style type="text/css">
    ..define all the styles...
 </style>
</head>

3) External CSS
---------------
In external CSS, the styles are defined in a separate file with the extension of .css ; and that can be integrated in an HTML document using <link>

<head>
 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css" />
</head>


CSS Selectors:
==============
- where to apply the style(s) is selector in CSS

Type of selectors are:

1) Tag/ Element Selectors:
--------------------------
It selects the HTML element by tag name.

Example : body	h1	p	div etc

h1{
 property: value;
}

2) ID Selector:
---------------
The id selector selects the "id" attribute of an HTML element.

ID selector starts with #

<div id="myregion">
 ............
</div>

<style type="text/css">
#myregion
{
  width: 350px;
  height: 250px;
  background-color: yellow;
}
</style>


3) Class Selector
-----------------
Class selector starts with . (period operator)

A class selector can be applied to any HTML tag by using the "class" attribute

<style type="text/css">
 .myclass
 {
  background-color:red;
 }
</style>

<h1 class="myclass"> ....</h1>
<p class="myclass"> ........</p>



If you want to specify that - only one specific HTML element (tag) should be affected, then you should use the element name with class selector. 

<style type="text/css">
h1.myclass
{
  text-align:center;
  color:blue;
}
</style>

Note: "myclass" style will be applied only for <h1>

<h1 class="myclass"> ....</h1>
<p class="myclass"> ........</p> [no effect]

4) Universal Selector:
----------------------
The universal selector is defined with * . It selects all the elements on the page. 

<style type="text/css">
 *
 {
  font-family:'verdana';
 }
</style>

5) Group Selector
-----------------
- used to provide common styles for multiple selectors
- group selector is created by separating each selector with a comma (,) 
- group selector is used to minimize the code. 

Example:
 <style>
    h1, h2, p 
    {  
     text-align: center;  
     color: blue;  
    }  
 </style>



CSS Comments
------------
inside <style> tag:

/*
 CSS comments here...
*/



Different ways of giving color value:
------------------
(1) Text Color name - red
(2) hex value - #ff0000
(3) hex value - #f00
(4) function - rgb(255,0,0)
(5) function - rgba(255,0,0,0.5)
(6) HSL - Hue Saturation Lighteness
	Hue -> 0 - 360
        Saturation - darkness % -> 0 -100
        Lightness - lightness % -> 0 - 100
(7) HSLA

RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color
 rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). 

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
0.6 means 60%
